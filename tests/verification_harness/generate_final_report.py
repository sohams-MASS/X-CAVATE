_NARRATIVE_HEADER = """# X-CAVATE Verification Harness — Final Report

This report compares three X-CAVATE pipelines on the seven networks under
`Vascular Trees Verification/` and documents the bugs found, fixes applied,
and residual differences that remain.

## Pipelines

| ID | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **science** | `xcavate_Science.py` (June 2023, Herrmann) | 5,568-line monolithic script. Three logging/typo bugs patched in `tests/verification_harness/science_runner.py` so it can run end-to-end. |
| **x1130** | `xcavate_11_30_25.py` (Nov 30 2025) | 5,568-line fork of Science.py. Two patches in `tests/verification_harness/x1130_runner.py`: the `custom_gcode == 1` gate on multimaterial-pressure emission, and an unguarded `graph[i].remove()` on the 500-vessel network. |
| **main** | `sohams-MASS/X-CAVATE` `xcavate/` package, branch `verification-harness` | Modular refactor with iterative DFS, KD-tree spatial queries, and dataclass-based config. Three correctness fixes applied during this work — see "Bugs fixed in main" below. |

The harness invokes each pipeline as a subprocess in an isolated working
directory, parses the emitted G-code, computes aggregate metrics, and
diffs each pair pairwise. `numerical_diff` uses `align_on_first_g1=True`
so a missing leading `G90` doesn't shift the entire stream.

## Inputs

Seven networks under `Vascular Trees Verification/`:

| Network | Vessels | Type |
|---|---:|---|
| `CNET Network/cnet_network_0_b_splines_100_points.txt` | 100 | single |
| `Figure 4 (F)/network_0_b_splines_4_vessels.txt` | 4 | single |
| `Figure 4 (F)/network_0_b_splines_9_vessels.txt` | 9 | single |
| `Figure 4 (F)/network_0_b_splines_14_vessels.txt` | 14 | single |
| `Figure 2 (A-C), Figure 4 (G)/multimaterial_test_network_61_vessels.txt` | 61 | **multi** |
| `Figure 2 (D-E)/5-1-23_multimaterial_network_0_b_splines.txt` | ~30 | **multi** |
| `network_0_b_splines_500_vessels (1).txt` | 500 | single (orphan — synthesized inlet/outlet) |

Canonical run parameters: `nozzle_diameter=0.41`, `container_height=50`,
`flow=0.1609429886081009` (matched to x1130's hardcoded value), `print_speed=1`,
`jog_speed=5`, `dwell_start=dwell_end=0.08`, `printer_type=0` (pressure),
`convert_factor=10.0` (cm→mm — main only; the legacy scripts hardcode
this).

"""

_RESULTS_INTRO = """
## Results

### Summary table

`max_xyz_dev` is the largest XYZ deviation (mm) between any pair of
G1 moves after preamble alignment. **0** = bit-identical G1 trajectories.
**5×10⁻⁷** = float-precision noise only (different decimal printing
between pipelines, no actual coordinate divergence).

"""


_BUGS_FIXED_BLOCK = """
## Bugs fixed in main (`sohams-MASS/X-CAVATE`)

1. **Inlet/outlet matching ran on the pre-interpolation 400-row coordinate
   array but the indices were used post-interpolation.** Fixed by moving
   the `match_inlet_outlet_nodes` call to AFTER `interpolate_network`
   (`xcavate/pipeline.py:104` → after `points_interp`). Eliminated the
   spurious branchpoint edges through misidentified outlets and the
   resulting +1 raw-DFS pass per network on every SM case.

2. **`classify_passes_by_material` indexed the LAST node of each pass
   (`nodes[-1]`) but the docstring said "second node".** The second-node
   choice in xcavate_11_30_25.py is more robust against material outliers
   at the tail of long passes. Implementation now matches the docstring
   and x1130's behavior (`xcavate/core/multimaterial.py`).

3. **`_subdivide_by_material` wrote swapped artven values back to the
   shared `points[n, 4]` column.** Branchpoint nodes appear in multiple
   passes; a swap performed for pass A leaked the mutated value into
   pass B's break detection, producing extra material-transition splits.
   x1130 keeps swap state in a per-pass-local `print_passes_processed_artven`
   dict. Fix: main now uses an `artven_local` dict per pass and never
   touches `points`. Result: dropped main's MM transition count from 205
   to 183 on the 61-vessel network, exactly matching x1130
   (`xcavate/pipeline.py:_subdivide_by_material`).

Each fix has a regression test under `tests/`:
- `tests/test_inlet_outlet_remap.py`
- `tests/test_multimaterial.py::test_multinode_uses_second_node`
- `tests/test_subdivide_by_material_swap_order.py`

A separate fix to `xcavate/core/multimaterial.py::classify_passes_by_material`
made it tolerate empty sub-passes that survive `_subdivide_by_material`'s
slicing — this allowed the multimaterial path to run at all on the
61-vessel network (previously crashed with `IndexError: list index out
of range`).

"""


_RESIDUAL_DIFFS_BLOCK = """
## Residual differences

After all the fixes above, the comparison stabilized at:

| Pair | 4/9/14/cnet/100/61-vessel | 5-1-23 MM | 500-vessel |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **x1130 ↔ main** | **0** mm (or float-precision noise 5e-7) | 5e-7 | **70.19 mm** |
| sci ↔ x1130 | 32–38 mm | 72.72 | 71.16 |
| sci ↔ main | 32–38 mm | 72.72 | 69.94 |

The 500-vessel row stands out: every pair shows ~70 mm divergence, even
though main↔x1130 is byte-identical on every smaller network.

### Why every pair diverges on 500-vessel

The graphs themselves differ. Comparing
`reports/network_0_b_splines_500_vessels_1/main/outputs/graph/graph.txt`
against the x1130 equivalent shows **38 lines of adjacency-list diff**
out of 127,812 lines (one entry per node × two pipelines). Examples:

```
Node 8282:
  main : [8282, 8283, 61712, 61713]   ← daughters {61712, 61713}
  x1130: [8282, 8283, 47083, 61712]   ← daughters {47083, 61712}

Node 19250:
  main : [19249, 19250, 19251]
  x1130: [19249, 19250, 19251, 25451]  ← x1130 has extra edge to 25451

Node 22435:
  main : [19251, 22435, 25451]
  x1130: [19251, 22434, 22435]
```

These aren't "x1130 forgot to remove an edge" patterns — they're
*different daughter assignments at branchpoints*. Same number of
neighbours, but different *which* node each pipeline picks as daughter.

**Cause: branchpoint daughter-selection ties.** Each pipeline finds
"nearest unvisited node in another vessel" with a different algorithm:

- **main** — `scipy.cKDTree.query(point, k=N)` (KD-tree, binary)
- **x1130** — nested-loop brute force with strict-less comparison
- **science** — same brute-force, slightly different loop ordering

When two candidate nodes are at *exactly equal* distance from a vessel
endpoint, the three implementations pick different ones. On 4–14 vessel
networks the geometry is sparse and ties rarely happen (graphs match
exactly → main↔x1130 = 0). On the 500-vessel dense vasculature, ~10–20
branchpoints have effectively-tied candidates → different daughter pairs
→ different adjacency edges → DFS visits in a different order → ~70 mm
pass-ordering divergence in the gcode.

All three pipelines still print *the same vessels with the same total
path*; only the visit order differs.

To force byte-equivalence on large networks would require adding an
explicit secondary tiebreaker (e.g., "on equal distance, pick smaller
node index") and applying it identically across all three
implementations. None of the three is currently "wrong" — they're all
valid choices for the same geometric configuration where multiple
daughter candidates are equidistant.

This is documented as the `branchpoint-tiebreak-large-network` known
delta in `tests/verification_harness/known_deltas.py`.

_LEGACY_PATCHES_BLOCK = """
## Legacy-script patches (in `tests/verification_harness/`)

The two legacy scripts are not modified on disk. Each is invoked through
a wrapper that applies in-memory patches before `exec`:

### `science_runner.py` (3 patches)

1. **`KeyError` in Branchpoint Condition #1 logging** (script line ~1781):
   the f-string referenced `append_first_branch[i]` inside a loop iterating
   `append_last_branch`. Fixed by mirroring the correct dict reference.
2. **`FileNotFoundError` in Branchpoint Condition #2** (script line ~2127):
   `open('changelog.txt,' 'a')` — comma INSIDE the filename literal
   produced the path `'changelog.txt,a'`. Fixed by moving the comma.
3. **`ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list`** in daughter-pair
   dedup (script line ~766): unguarded `graph[i].remove(daughter_to_remove)`.
   Fixed with an `if x in graph[i]:` guard.

### `x1130_runner.py` (2 patches)

1. **`gcode_MM_pressure.txt` never emitted** (script line 4717): the
   multimaterial-pressure writer was gated on `custom_gcode == 1`.
   Without `--custom 1`, x1130 silently skipped MM emission and only
   wrote `gcode_SM_pressure.txt`, reporting 0 nozzle transitions on
   multimaterial inputs. Fixed by dropping the `custom_gcode == 1`
   condition.
2. **Same `graph[i].remove()` bug** as Science (script line ~878).
   Fixed with the same `if x in graph[i]:` guard.

x1130 also hardcodes `flow = 0.1609429886081009` at script line 3705,
overriding its own `--flow` argparse value. This is not patched; the
harness's `CANONICAL_PARAMS["flow"]` is set to the same value so all
three pipelines compute feedrates on identical flow.
